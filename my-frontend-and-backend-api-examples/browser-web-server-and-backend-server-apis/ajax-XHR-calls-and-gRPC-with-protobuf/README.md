# ajax-XHR-calls-and-gRPC-with-protobuf

_The API will use an **ajax XHR call**
written in javascript and php
and **gRPC with protobuf**
written in go and php.
Two numbers will be
sent from a browser (client)
to a web server (server).
Two numbers will then be
sent from the web server (client)
to a backend server (server)
that will calculate
and return the sum.
A webpage will be used to
enter the data and
display the roundtrip results._
